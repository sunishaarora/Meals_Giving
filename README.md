## Features

The Meals Giving App offers the following key features:

1. Restaurant Donations: Restaurants can create listings for surplus food items available for donation. They can provide details such as the type of food, quantity, and pickup instructions. This feature encourages businesses to donate excess food and prevents it from going to waste.

2. Charity Requests: Charities can submit requests for food donations based on their current needs. They can specify the type and quantity of food required and provide additional information about their organization. This feature enables charities to easily access donated meals to support their community initiatives.

3. Matching Algorithm: The app utilizes a matching algorithm to connect restaurant donations with charity requests. By considering factors such as proximity, quantity, and food type, the algorithm ensures efficient and suitable matches, optimizing the distribution of donated meals.

4. User Management: The app provides user authentication and management functionalities for both restaurants and charities. Users can create accounts, log in, and update their profile information. This feature ensures secure and personalized access to the app's features.
